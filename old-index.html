					<h2>Anheuser-Busch Brewery</h2>
					<p>St. Louis has a long and storied history, and one of the earliest and most prominent businesses in St. Louis was the Anheuser-Busch Brewery. Today, the brewery still stands, open for tourists to gander at the wonder and size of this monumental operation. The best part about touring the brewery is the free beer! However, the famous Clydesdales (and their Dalmation counterparts) are also housed here, and come in a close second.</p>

						<h3>Honrable Mentions</h3>
					</header>
					<section>
						<h4>Germany</h4>
						<p>Across two different trips, I've spent a total of 6 weeks in Germany. My first trip was a month-long backpacking excursion in 2003 that took my travel companion and I through most major regions of the country. We spent time in Heidelberg, Mahneim, Munich, Berlin, Hamburg, D&uuml;sseldorf, K&ouml;ln (Cologne), and Frankfurt.</p
						<p>I returned in 2009 to spend two weeks visiting my friend and college roommate in Munich, where he was working as a physicist.</p>

						<h4>New York, NY</h4>
						<p>I never occupied a residence in New York City, but I spend countless days in the city while living on Long Island. The days were an even mix of trips to the city to take classes at Columbia University (where my advisor had a visiting position), seeing live music, and visiting friends in Brooklyn and Queens.</p>
